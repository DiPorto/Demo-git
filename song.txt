Satani, Satani, in amus dignita
Send to inferno the demons allied
Prayer for prayer the deal
More than a martyr can take
Fire them back to the dark of the night
And we all
Die, die, die tonight
Die, die, dynamite
We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
We are cursed and denied
And at midnight forever we are
Die, die, dynamite
